  helpWhatIsItText: This game was created to test the practical accuracy of the Monty
    Hall Problem.
  helpMontyHallProblemHeader: What is the Monty Hall Problem?
  helpMontyHallProblemText: 'The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based
    on the American TV game show Let''s Make a Deal, named after the show''s host,
    Monty Hall.

    

    In the game, there are three doors: behind one is a
    car, and behind the other two are goats. You initially choose door number 1.
    The host then opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat and shows it to you.
    He then asks: ''Would you like to switch to door number 2?'' So, is it advantageous
    to change your choice in this situation?

    

    Here, we will find the
    answer to this question in our game.'
